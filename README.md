# DATA-tableau-baseball-story-telling
I apply data visualization principles to the data analysis process and tell a story with data.  I use Tableau to create these explanatory visualizations.  I iterated through the visualizations by getting and responding to feedback.  The story looks at a baseball dataset and compares relationships between performance variables and attributes of the given athletes.
